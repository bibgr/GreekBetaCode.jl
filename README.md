# This is a greek language only --- hence, partial --- implementation of the TLG速 Beta Code  [1]
# that aims to cover enough codepoints as to represent an entire Greek New Testament edition  in
# Beta Code and in corresponding Unicode, with the SBL Greek New Testament  in  mind,  including
# (i) the Greek Alphabet (subsection 1.1 of [1]); (ii) basic Greek punctuation  (subsection  1.1
# of [1]); (iii) combining Greek Diacritics (subsection 1.3 of [1]); as  well  as  partial  (iv)
# quotation marks (subsection 3.1 of [1]); (v) brackets (subsection 3.2 of [1]); (vi) additional
# punctuation and characters (subsections 3.3 and 3.4 of [1]). The code has been revised  as  to
# include  most  Greek  uses  and  mitigating  Beta  Code's  redundancies,  which  appear  quite
# frequently. Some rules from [2] are accounted for in convertion  algorithms,  such  as  prefer
# lower Unicode codepoints when Unicode is redundant, and prefer characters with diacritics over
# sequences of plain characters plus combining  diacritics  (so  that  converting  from  and  to
# Unicode actually normalizes characters).
